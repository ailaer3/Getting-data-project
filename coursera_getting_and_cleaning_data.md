# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

## Course Project

1. In this project we need to submit a tidy data set, a link to a github repository with a script for the analysis and a codebook describing the cariables.

2. The data should be obtained from the links in the instructions of the project

3. We should write an R script called run_analysis. R that merges the training and the test sets in one data set, extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation, name the activities in the data set, label the data set and create a tidy data set with the averageof each variable for each activity and each subject.
